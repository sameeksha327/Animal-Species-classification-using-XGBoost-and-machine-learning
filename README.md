🐾 Animal Classification Using Machine Learning

 📘 Project Overview
This project classifies animals into different species using their biological features such as hair, feathers, egg-laying traits, and more.  
The goal is to automate and simplify the process of species identification efficiently using a machine learning model.

 🧠 Objective
To build a machine learning model that predicts the class of an animal based on its physical and biological characteristics using the **Zoo dataset**.

 🧰 Technologies Used
- Python  
- XGBoost  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- Scikit-learn  
- Matplotlib  

 📊 Dataset
Dataset Name: Zoo Dataset  
Source: [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Zoo)  
Description: 
The dataset contains 101 animals described by 16 Boolean features such as:
- Hair
- Feathers
- Eggs
- Milk
- Airborne
- Aquatic
- Predator  
and one **class type** indicating the category of the animal.

⚙️ Project Workflow
1. Data Preprocessing – Cleaned and encoded categorical features.  
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) – Visualized patterns and feature relationships.  
3. Model Building – Implemented **XGBoost Classifier** for prediction.  
4. Model Evaluation – Checked accuracy and analyzed feature importance.  
5. Result Interpretation – Identified key traits influencing classification.

 🚀 Results
- Achieved high prediction accuracy for animal classes.  
- Top influencing features: **hair**, **feathers**, and **milk**.  
- Demonstrated how machine learning can automate biological classification tasks.
